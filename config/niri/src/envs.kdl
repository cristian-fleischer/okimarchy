// Environment variable overrides for Niri
// Note: Niri doesn't support env directives like Hyprland
// Environment variables are typically set through uwsm or shell profiles
//
// This file is kept for consistency with the modular structure
// but will not affect the Niri environment directly.
//
// To set environment variables for Niri sessions:
// 1. Use ~/.config/environment.d/ files
// 2. Set them in your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc)
// 3. Use uwsm environment configuration
